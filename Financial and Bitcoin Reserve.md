## Debt Agreements in Fiat with third parties, (initial state of community)

-   All assets will be taken as collateral. Property, House, Tools, Lobour, Man Power, Assets in bank accounts, Bitcoin reserve, ...

## Bitcoin Reserve

### General Contribution Idea

-   The community will need its contributions to cover the initial debt position and contribute in growing its bitcoin reserve
-   All financal contributions from members, should be moved to the bitcoin reserve
-   All donations from third partied, should be moved to the bitcoin reserve
-   All surplus from community activities, should be moved to the bitcoin reserve

### General Contribution Idea

-   All expenses (in general terms), should be minted as debt against the bitcoin reserve
-   Minted e.g. Frankencoin, DAI, ... could be transfered into FIAT Euro or Franks to make FIAT expense payments. Read more https://frankencoin.com/
